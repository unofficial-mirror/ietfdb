     extension annotation {
       argument name;
       description
	 "This extension allows for defining metadata annotations in
	  YANG modules.  The 'md:annotation' statement can appear only
	  at the top level of a YANG module or submodule, i.e., it
	  becomes a new alternative in the ABNF production rule for
	  'body-stmts' (Section 14 in RFC 7950).

	  The argument of the 'md:annotation' statement defines the name
	  of the annotation.  Syntactically, it is a YANG identifier as
	  defined in Section 6.2 of RFC 7950.

	  An annotation defined with this 'extension' statement inherits
	  the namespace and other context from the YANG module in which
	  it is defined.

	  The data type of the annotation value is specified in the same
	  way as for a leaf data node using the 'type' statement.

	  The semantics of the annotation and other documentation can be
	  specified using the following standard YANG substatements (all
	  are optional): 'description', 'if-feature', 'reference',
	  'status', and 'units'.

	  A server announces support for a particular annotation by
	  including the module in which the annotation is defined among
	  the advertised YANG modules, e.g., in a NETCONF <hello>
	  message or in the YANG library (RFC 7950).  The annotation can
	  then be attached to any instance of a data node defined in any
	  YANG module that is advertised by the server.

	  XML encoding and JSON encoding of annotations are defined in
	  RFC 7952.";

3. JSON example

   The JSON object should look like this:

   {
       "test": 1234
   }

4. Security Considerations

   There are none.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No new registrations for IANA.

   [RFC8175] is mentioned here in order to give the reference
   classification code a chance to mess up.
