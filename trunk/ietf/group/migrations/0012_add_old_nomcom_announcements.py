This is the call for volunteers to participate in the 2002 IETF
Nominations Committee, the committee that will select this year's
nominees for the IAB and the IESG.  Details about the Nominations
Committee process can be found in RFC 2727.

The NomCom is the IETF's way of choosing its leadership. Typically,
half of the IAB and half of the IESG is selected each year. It is
possible that the NomCom will have to fill more or fewer slots than
this, due to the creation or elimination of positions by the IESG,
resignations, transfers, etc. IESG members whose terms are up are
Harald Alvestrand, IETF Chair; Scott Bradner, Transport; Randy Bush,
Operations &amp; Management; Patrik Faltstrom, Applications; Thomas Narten,
Internet; Bill Fenner, Routing; and Jeff Schiller, Security. IAB
members whose terms are up are: Ran Atkinson, Rob Austein, Fred Baker,
Steve Deering, Sally Floyd, and Geoff Huston.

For the NomCom to work as it should, the pool from which the volunteers
are chosen should be as large as possible. The more people who
volunteer, the better chance we have of choosing a random yet
representative cross section of the IETF population. Volunteering for
the NomCom is also a good way of serving the IETF community. So please
volunteer.

NomCom members are barred from nomination during the year they serve,
even if they later resign. Therefore being selected for the NomCom
provides complete immunity against selection for the IAB or IESG during
that year.

People who volunteer should be sure they can the afford the time,
several hours per week for the next 4-5 months.  The task basically
involves the following activities:

  - Reading candidate's statements
  - Participating in a weekly 2 hour conference call.
  - Attending the IETF meetings held during the selection process.
  - Doing several interviews.
  - Speaking to IETF participants about the candidates, the job
    requirements or the process.

All NomCom deliberations and supporting information that relates to
specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
confidential. The NomCom members will be exposed to confidential
information as a result of their deliberations, their interactions with
those they consult, and from those who provide requested supporting
information. All members are expected to handle this information in a
manner consistent with its sensitivity.

To qualify as a volunteer, a person needs to have attended 2 out of the
last 3 IETF meetings.  Anyone who meets this requirement is invited to
volunteer by emailing your name, telephone number(s), and email address
to proberts@megisto.com no later than September 6, 2002.  Please put
"NOMCOM VOLUNTEER" in the subject line.

Once the list closes, I'll provide the list to the IETF secretariat who
will verify the eligibility of the each of the volunteers (e.g. has
attended at least 2 of the last 3 IETFs).  I will also ask them to
publish the list prior to verification for volunteers to confirm that I
actually received their email volunteering.  This list will be
published at: http://www.ietf.org/nomcom/index.html

We will then run the selection process and announce the results the
week of September 16, 2002. Ten (10) NomCom voting members will be
chosen from the pool of volunteers according to the procedure described
by Donald Eastlake in RFC 2777, "Publicly Verifiable Nomcom Random
Selection". The source of randomness will be based on the shares traded
number of 12 stocks selected by the NomCom chair.

The official shares traded numbers (denoted in 000s) will be drawn from
the September 16, 2002 Wall Street Journal which reports the sales
figures from the previous trading day - September 13, 2002. If trading
in any of the stocks  is suspended, then the shares traded will be
assumed to be 0.

Please volunteer.

Thank you,

Phil Roberts &lt;proberts@megisto.com&gt;

 One of the roles of the ISOC President is to appoint the IETF Nominations 
Committee chair. This is done through consultation with the IETF and IAB Chairs 
as well as the ISOC Executive Committee and it gives us great pleasure to announce 
that Rich Draves has agreed to serve as the 2003 IETF Nominations Committee chair. 
Rich can be reached at <richdr@microsoft.com>.

A Call for Nominations for this committee will be sent shortly to the IETF 
Announcement list; and a list of the IESG and IAB seats to be filled will also be 
published shortly. Please give serious consideration to possible candidates for these
posts and in the interim, make your suggestions known to Rich, who will share them 
with the committee when seated.

This is an ambitious undertaking and it is important that the entire IETF community 
assist as much as possible. Thank you in advance for your support and a sincere thank
you to Rich for agreeing to take on this important responsibility.

	n.message_set.create(by=p, subject="NomCom call for volunteers", time=datetime(2003,9,22),

This is the call for volunteers to participate in the 2003 IETF Nominations Committee, 
the committee that will select this year's nominees for the IAB and the IESG.

The NomCom is the IETF's way of choosing its leadership. Typically, half of the IAB 
and half of the IESG is selected each year. It is possible that the NomCom will have 
to fill more or fewer slots than this, due to the creation or elimination of positions 
by the IESG, resignations, transfers, etc. IESG members whose terms are up are: 
Ned Freed, Applications; Bert Wijnen, Operations and Management; Alex Zinin, 
Routing; Steve Bellovin, Security; and Allison Mankin, Transport. 
IAB members whose terms are up are: Leslie Daigle, Patrik Faltstrom, 
Charlie Kaufman, James Kempf, Eric Rescorla, and Mike St. Johns.

For the NomCom to work as it should, the pool from which the volunteers are chosen 
should be as large as possible. The more people who volunteer, the better chance 
we have of choosing a random yet representative cross section of the IETF population. 
Volunteering for the NomCom is also a good way of serving the IETF community. 
So please volunteer.

NomCom members are barred from nomination during the year they serve, even if they 
later resign. Therefore being selected for the NomCom provides complete immunity against 
selection for the IAB or IESG during that year.

People who volunteer should be sure they can the afford the time, several hours per week 
for the next 4-5 months.  The task basically involves the following activities:

- Reading candidate's statements
- Participating in a weekly 2 hour conference call.
- Attending the IETF meetings held during the selection process.
- Doing several interviews.
- Speaking to IETF participants about the candidates, the job requirements, or the process.

All NomCom deliberations and supporting information that relates to specific nominees, 
candidates, and confirmed candidates are confidential. The NomCom members will be exposed 
to confidential information as a result of their deliberations, their interactions with 
those they consult, and from those who provide requested supporting information. 
All members are expected to handle this information in a manner consistent with 
its sensitivity.

Details about the Nominations Committee process can be found in RFC 2727 and 
draft-ietf-nomcom-rfc2727bis-07.txt. The 2003 NomCom will use RFC 2727 until 2727bis 
is approved as an RFC, at which time we will switch (as much as possible) to 2727bis.

To qualify as a volunteer, a person needs to have attended 2 out of the last 3 IETF meetings 
(according to RFC 2727) or 3 out of the last 5 IETF meetings (according to 2727bis). 
Anyone who meets either of these requirements is invited to volunteer by emailing your name, 
telephone number(s), and email address to richdr@microsoft.com no later than noon in Seattle 
on October 3, 2003.  Please put "NOMCOM VOLUNTEER" in the subject line.

I will check the eligibility of volunteers against both criteria and publish a up-to-date 
list of verified volunteers at http://www.ietf.org/nomcom/index.html. On October 3, 
I will decide whether to use the 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 rule, depending on whether 2727bis 
has been approved by that date. This will result in a final list of volunteers.

I will then run the selection process and announce the results on October 10, 2003. 
Ten NomCom voting members will be chosen from the pool of volunteers according to the 
procedure described by Donald Eastlake in RFC 2777, "Publicly Verifiable Nomcom Random 
Selection". The source of randomness will be based on the shares-traded number of 12 stocks 
selected by the NomCom chair.

The official shares-traded numbers (denoted in 000s) will be drawn from the October 10, 2003 
Wall Street Journal which reports the sales figures from the previous trading day - October 9,
2003. If trading in any of the stocks is suspended, then the shares traded will be assumed 
to be 0.

The NomCom voting members will start their term on October 17, after the IETF community 
has had a chance to review the random selection process.

Please volunteer.

Thank you,

Rich Draves <richdr@microsoft.com>

The final list of volunteers for the 2003 NomCom can be found at
http://www.ietf.org/nomcom. I would like to thank everyone who
volunteered.

I will run the selection process and announce the results on October 10,
2003. Ten NomCom voting members will be chosen from the pool of
volunteers according to the procedure described by Donald Eastlake in
RFC 2777, "Publicly Verifiable Nomcom Random Selection". The source of
randomness will be based on the shares-traded number of the 12 stocks
specified below.

At this time, 2727bis has not yet been approved as an RFC. Hence I will
use RFC 2727's eligibility criteria (attended 2 of the last 3 IETF
meetings) when performing the random selection. I will not check the
primary affiliation of the volunteers. If the RFC 2777 algorithm selects
an ineligible volunteer, I will repeat the method until I have ten
eligible and willing volunteers.

The official shares-traded numbers (denoted in 000s) will be drawn from
the October 10, 2003 Wall Street Journal which reports the sales figures
from the previous trading day - October 9, 2003. If trading in any of
the stocks is suspended, then the shares traded will be assumed to be 0.

The NomCom voting members will start their term on October 17, after the

The IAB has not yet selected its liaison - that should happen next week.

The ISOC has appointed Brian Carpenter <brc@zurich.ibm.com> as its
liaison. Because 2727bis has not yet been approved, following the
procedures of RFC 2727 I will propose the addition of Brian as a
liaison, subject to the nomcom's approval.

For mid-term vacancies, RFC 2727 says "the selection and confirmation
process is expected to be completed within 1 month." However, there are
several factors that make a one-month schedule impractical in this
situation.

1. Some nominees for Randy's O&M AD position are also under
consideration for other positions.
2. The two O&M ADs need to have complementary skills.
3. Candidates with operational experience & relationships are rare.
4. The Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons.

To have the best chance of producing a high-quality result, the NomCom
(after consulting with ISOC and the IAB as confirming body) has arrived
at the following schedule for filling Randy Bush's O&M AD position:

1. Nominations due to NomCom by Dec 1, 2003.
2. NomCom produces confidential short-list by Dec 10.
3. NomCom makes decision by Dec 22.
4. NomCom notifies IAB on Jan 5, 2004.
5. IAB confirms (or rejects) by Jan 19.
